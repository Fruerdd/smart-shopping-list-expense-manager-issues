## Mockups

- Visual mockups and wireframes will be designed using Figma.
- Each feature will have an associated wireframe illustrating its UI/UX.
- Mockups will be stored in the `mockups/` folder in the repository.

## Data Source for Markets & Items

Instead of markets being user-managed, the admin will maintain the market and product database. A CSV file (potentially sourced from Kaggle or other datasets) will contain:

- A list of grocery items
- Prices of items across different markets
- Market names and locations

This data will be used to populate and maintain the price comparison functionality.

## Intelligent Shopping List Management

Users can:

- **Search for Items:** Items available will appear under the search bar.
- **Smart Store Selection:** Automatically selects the product from:
  - The cheapest store
  - A preferred store (if set)
  - A favorite store (based on past purchases)
- **Grouped Shopping Logic:** Ensures most items are bought from the same store unless price differences are significant.
- **Manual Store Selection:** Users can override automatic selection.

## Referral & Loyalty System

### **Referral System**
- Users can invite friends via a unique referral code or link.
- Both the referrer and the new user receive rewards upon sign-up and first purchase.
- The system tracks successful referrals.

### **Loyalty Program**
- Users earn points for purchases.
- Points can be redeemed for discounts and exclusive deals.
- Loyalty tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold) offer increasing rewards.
